Done:
- Generate Dataset: Real spectra vs synthitic spectra
- Create Dataloader for spectra
- Create original CycleGAN for this data type
- Add TTUR

TODO:
- Add Wasserstein Loss + Spectral Normalization
    - Use a linear activation function in the output layer of the critic model (instead of sigmoid).
    - Use Wasserstein loss to train the critic and generator models that promote larger difference between scores for real and generated images.
    - Constrain critic model weights to a limited range after each mini batch update (e.g. [-0.01,0.01]).
    - Update the critic model more times than the generator each iteration (e.g. 5).
    - Use the RMSProp version of gradient descent with small learning rate and no momentum (e.g. 0.00005).

- Get Random Forrest Network from Drithiman
- Add Perceptual Feature Loss
