TODO:
- Test with small set of labeled data
- Infinite Stream of simulated spectra
- Increase noise level of real spectra to get more samples
- Run against LCModel

- Loss functions
    - wavelet
    - cosine embedding loss (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CosineEmbeddingLoss.html)

- Style Prediction:
    1 Style parameters. Style gets directly added in physics model
        ✅ Enforce how to use parameter
        ✅ Easily integrateable to REG-CycleGAN
        ✅ Easily aplicable for reverse cycle
        ❌ Makes quantity prediction fuzzy
        ❌ Cannot recreate spectrum perfectly
    2 Style vector. Style gets directly added in Generator
        ✅ Generator can decide how to use vector
        ✅ Perfect reconstruction possible
        ❌ No control how vector is used
        ❌ Reverse cycle needs cached style vectors
