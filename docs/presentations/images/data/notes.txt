epoch_69_batch_0_fig.png/svg
Very close alignment. Highlights the frequency shift - only off by a smidge

epoch_71_batch_3_fig.png/svg
Should not have been included in the training data, but highlights the effectiveness of the noise estimation

epoch_74_batch_2_fig.png/svg
Amplitudes are off, but line broadening appears on point

epoch_75_batch_2_fig.png/svg
Similar to 69_0, but improved frequency shift

epoch_1_batch_0_fig.png/svg
Even at the beginning, some estimates are decent. Phase matches pretty well. Frequency shift is close. Noise and amplitudes are off.

Others are rather terrible at the beginning
